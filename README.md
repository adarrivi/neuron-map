Neuron-map
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adarrivi/neuron-map.png)](https://travis-ci.org/adarrivi/neuron-map)

Simulation of an invented neuronal model to see how it behaves.

Basically there are two types of neurons: fast and slow. Both have different thresholds for being activated, with different span life.

Neuron span in the different grids depending on the amount of spikes being send for that grid


And [here](http://youtu.be/ncNWgNWgwTo) to see it in action :)
